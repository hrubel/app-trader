For this porject, team was given data containing two tables without a key to parse through and find trends in. They asked us to make a recommendation for the top 10 mobile apps to invest in, so they could maximize profit from in-app advertising and purchases. We used SQL queries on data from Apple and Android stores, and when we came up with our finding, we created a presentation in Google sheets to visualize our conclusion.
